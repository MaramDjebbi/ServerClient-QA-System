# ServerClient-QA-System
 A client/server communication system with a random number request and response protocol using named pipes and SIGUSR1 signals.

# Introduction
This report presents a client-server communication system. The server is waiting customer questions via a named pipe (fifo1). Each question contains a request to send 'n' numbers randomly generated by the server. The customer also sends its identifier to be notified by the server via a signal SIGUSR1. A protocol is established to ensure that each customer receives their answers correctly. The client signals to the server when it has finished reading its answers. This report provides brief explanations of the different code files of the different modules.

# Components
## serveur.c
The code in this file implements a server that communicates with a client via named pipes.
● It creates two named pipes for communication with clients. 
● Initializes a random number generator.
● Installs signal handlers: one to react to the signal SIGUSR1 (used to wake up the client), and the other to manage the end of the server in response to other signals.
● The server enters a loop where it loads and processes questions client. He reads a question from the customer.
● It generates a random response and sends it to the client. It sends a signal to the client to wake him up.
● It waits for a signal to continue.
● If reading the question fails or takes too long, the server waits briefly.

## client.c
The code in this file involves a client communicating with a server via named tubes.
● It opens named pipes for communication.
● Initializes a random number generator.
● Installs a signal handler to react to the SIGUSR1 signal.
● Generates a random question, sends it to the server and waits for a response.
● Reads the response from the server, sends a signal to the server, and processes the response.
● Closes the tubes and ends the program.

## serv_cli_fifo.h 
The code in this file provides headers for essential system files, such as <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <unistd.h>, <sys/stat.h>, <sys/types.h>, <fcntl.h>, <errno.h>,
<time.h>, and <signal.h>. It also defines shared constants and macros between clients and servers, such as NMAX to define a maximum size, as well as the named pipe paths (fifo1, fifo2, etc.) to establish the communication between processes. Additionally, this code includes the definition of data structures to represent a question and an answer, allowing thus organize and transmit this information between the different components of the program.

## Handlers_Serv.h
This file contains two signal management functions for the server:
● hand_reveil(int sig): is a function that reacts to reception of the signal SIGUSR1. This function is used to signal to the server that a client wants to interact with it.
● end_server(int sig): is a function which reacts to the reception of any what signal. It is designed to manage the termination of the server in reaction to the reception of any signal.

## Handlers_cli.h
When the “SIGUSER1” signal is received, the function displays the message “Sending SIGUSER1" signal to standard output using printf. Additionally, this function
is designed to wake the client in response to receiving the SIGUSR1 signal.
Thus, it serves as a mechanism to notify and wake up the client following an event.
particular, triggered by sending this specific signal.

## Makefile
Our “Makefile” is designed to compile client and server source code, creates fifo directory, provides targets to run server and client in separate GNOME Terminal windows and includes a clean target to clean the generated files and directory.
The sleep command in the “run_client” target introduces a 5 seconds delay after running the client program before closing the terminal window.
